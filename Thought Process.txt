1. On seeing the two examples given for the question, I could infer two things:
   
   1) The blocks are flipped
   2) The indexing of the blocks is 1-indexing rather than 0-indexing

   Before I proceed with the solution to the problem, my first step will be to validate whether all the variable are within the permissible range.

   In order to solve this question, for each pizzeria, I would create a N*N matrix first where every square represents one
   block of the city. In the matrix, the element or the location which a pizzeria can deliver to will be 1 and the other elements
   will be 0. Also, the location of the pizzeria will be marked as 1 in the matrix. Then, I would sum up the matrices for each pizzeria.
   Before summing up the matrices, I also need to make sure that the matrices are flipped and they have 0-indexing rather than 1-indexing.

   The largest element in the resulting sum matrix will be the location where Mr Z has to move in, in order to have the greates selection of pizzas.

3. The complexity of the solution will be O((N^2)) where N in the number of rows/columns of the matrix. I think this is the best solution that I could come up with.
